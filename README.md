Nightscout Lite is a very simple Android application that uses this API from Nighscout: https://github.com/nightscout/cgm-remote-monitor/wiki/API-v1.0.0-beta-Endpoints. It shows a chart with the last blood glucose values, the NS profile and provides the possibility to set limits and trigger visual alarms accordingly.
